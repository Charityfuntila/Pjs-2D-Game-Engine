A Processing library for use in 2D game making,
fully compatible with online deployedment via
the Processing.js library.

Documentation pending

tests are in the ./tests/ directory

This is a work in progress pending initial release.
Due to the lack of license, any license that ends up
being put on this will apply retroactively. That
means you can play with it, as long as you realise
that deployment before this becomes a public release
is probably not the best of ideas.
