    <h1>Let's make a Mario game.</h1>
    
    <p>We had a look at some of the basics of making a game using the Processing.js game
    library, so let's kick it up a notch by just getting down and making our own Super
    Mario game. When we're done with this part of the tutorial, we'll have a game with
    koopa troopers, platforms that we can jump up through but not fall down through,
    a hole with terrible muncher plants, coins, including a mysterious dragon coin,
    a giant banzai bill bullet that comes out of nowhere, and even some advanced things
    like not actually putting enemies in the level from the start, but only just before
    you get to where they're supposed to be.</p>
    
    <p>And it's going to be pretty sweet. Let's get started!</p>
    
    <h2>First stop: we need a Mario</h2>
    
    <p>Okay, almost. Before the first stop, we'll need a game with at least
    one level which has at least one level layer so that we can even put
    mario somewhere. Just like we did last time. So let's get cracking:</p>
    
    <textarea readonly style="width: 40em; height: 26em;">
final int screenWidth = 512;
final int screenHeight = 432;

void initialize() {
  addLevel("level", new MarioLevel(width, height));  
}

class MarioLevel extends Level {
  MarioLevel(float levelWidth, float levelHeight) {
    super(levelWidth, levelHeight);
    addLevelLayer("layer", new MarioLayer(this));
  }
}

class MarioLayer extends LevelLayer {
  MarioLayer(Level owner) {
    super(owner);
    setBackgroundColor(color(0, 100, 190));
    addBoundary(new Boundary(0,height-48,width,height-48));
    showBoundaries = true;
  }
}
</textarea>

    <p>This sets up an empty, but for all intents and purposes functional, game world
    that we can stick Mario in:</p>

    <figure>
      <canvas data-processing-sources="codebase.pde sketches/mario/sketch00.pde"></canvas>
       <figcaption>An empty game world</figcaption>
    </figure> 

    <p>So now we can make Mario. First, let's think of what we want Mario
    to be able to do: </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>he can stand around,</li>
      <li>sometimes he runs around,</li>
      <li>he also likes to jump around, and</li>
      <li>unfortunately, he can die =(</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>So, let's find some pictures for all these different things:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Standing around: <img src="graphics/mario/small/Standing-mario.gif"></li>
      <li>Running: <img src="graphics/mario/small/Running-mario.gif"></li>
      <li>Jumping: <img src="graphics/mario/small/Jumping-mario.gif"></li>
      <li>Losing: <img src="graphics/mario/small/Dead-mario.gif"></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>You'll notice that some of these states use multiple pictures. This lets us
    create the illusion of "animation": if we loop through the images quickly enough,
    it'll see like Mario's animated, and that's good! So let's make a Mario!</p>

    <textarea readonly style="width: 60em; height: 17em;">
class Mario extends Player {
  Mario(float x, float y) {
    super("Mario");
    setupStates();
    setPosition(x,y);
  }
  void setupStates() {
    addState(new State("idle", "graphics/mario/small/Standing-mario.gif"));
    addState(new State("running", "graphics/mario/small/Running-mario.gif",1,4));
    addState(new State("jumping", "graphics/mario/small/Jumping-mario.gif"));
    addState(new State("dead", "graphics/mario/small/Dead-mario.gif",1,2));
    setCurrentState("idle");    
  }
}
</textarea>

    <p>And then let's add a mario to our world:</p>
    
    <textarea readonly style="width: 40em; height: 12em;">
class MarioLayer extends LevelLayer {
  MarioLayer(Level owner) {
    super(owner);
    setBackgroundColor(color(0, 100, 190));
    addBoundary(new Boundary(0,height-48,width,height-48));
    showBoundaries = true;
    Mario mario = new Mario(width/2, height/2);
    addPlayer(mario);
  }
}
</textarea>

    <figure>
      <canvas data-processing-sources="codebase.pde preloads.pde sketches/mario/sketch01.pde"></canvas>
       <figcaption>A world with a Mario</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <h2>Making mario actually do things</h2>
    
    <p>This is nice and all, but like the previous tutorial, nothing's
    happening. Mario just hangs there. So, let's make things a little more
    interesting. First, let's
    introduce some gravity.</p>
    
    <p>We introduce three new global values:</p>
    
    <textarea readonly style="width: 40em; height: 4em;">
float DOWN_FORCE = 2;
float ACCELERATION = 1.3;
float DAMPENING = 0.75;
</textarea>

    <p>The "down force" value determines how much players and NPCs etc will
    be "pushed down" towards the ground when they're not standing on anything.
    The "acceleration" value determines how much they will accelerate while
    they're falling, so that the longer they fall, the faster they fall,
    and the "dampening" value determines what happens when we give players
    or NPCs an impulse (= some speed). With dampening set to "1", the
    amount of speed is the same from one frame to the next. "0.5" will halve
    the amount of speed per frame, and "0" will kill off speed complete
    from one frame to the next.</p>
    
    <p>Of course, we also need to make sure those forces apply to Mario,
    so we modify our constructor:</p>

<textarea readonly style="width: 40em; height: 10em;">
  Mario(float x, float y) {
    super("Mario");
    setupStates();
    setPosition(x,y);
    setForces(0,DOWN_FORCE);
    setAcceleration(0,ACCELERATION);
    setImpulseCoefficients(DAMPENING,DAMPENING);
  }
</textarea>
    
    <figure>
      <canvas data-processing-sources="codebase.pde preloads.pde sketches/mario/sketch02.pde"></canvas>
       <figcaption>A world with a Mario. And gravity.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>Excellent! now Mario's on the ground... but.. still not doing
    very much. So, time to hook up the controls. We will be using "WASD"
    controls again, so that 'W' means "up", 'A' means "left", 'S' means...
    ... well we're not actually going to use 'S', but 'D', means "right".</p>

<textarea readonly style="width: 40em; height: 23em;">
  Mario(float x, float y) {
    super("Mario");
    setupStates();
    setPosition(x,y);
    handleKey('W');
    handleKey('A');
    handleKey('D');
    setForces(0,DOWN_FORCE);
    setAcceleration(0,ACCELERATION);
    setImpulseCoefficients(DAMPENING,DAMPENING);
  }
  
  [...]

  void handleInput() {
    if (isKeyDown('A')) { addImpulse(-2, 0); }
    if (isKeyDown('D')) { addImpulse(2, 0); }
    if (isKeyDown('W')) { addImpulse(0,-10); }
  }  
</textarea>

    <figure>
      <canvas data-processing-sources="codebase.pde preloads.pde sketches/mario/sketch03.pde"></canvas>
       <figcaption>A world with a Mario. And gravity. And controls</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>At this point, Mario is still fairly boring. Sure, we can
    control him, but none of those fancy states are being used, so
    let's refind the input handling (you may remember binding keys to
    motion controls in the previous tutorial) so that when we walk left or
    right, we actually show as running, and when we jump, we actually
    look like we're jumping.</p>
    
    <p>hang on to your pants, this one's a biggy:</p>

<textarea readonly style="width: 60em; height: 30em;">
  void handleInput() {
    // handle running
    if(isKeyDown('A') || isKeyDown('D')) {
      if (isKeyDown('A')) {
        setHorizontalFlip(true);
        addImpulse(-2, 0);
      }
      if (isKeyDown('D')) {
        setHorizontalFlip(false);
        addImpulse(2, 0);
      }
      setCurrentState("running");
    }

    // handle jumping
    if(isKeyDown('W') && active.name!="jumping" && boundaries.size()>0) {
      addImpulse(0,-35);
      setCurrentState("jumping");
    }
    
    if(!isKeyDown('A') && !isKeyDown('D') && !isKeyDown('W')) {
      setCurrentState("idle");
    }
  }
</textarea>

    <p>So what does this code do? Let's look at the three parts that this 
    code can be looked at, separately. First, the first "if" statement.<p>
    
    <p>The first "if" statement checks for the 'A' and 'D' keys, which
    correspond to walking left and right, respectively. The trick here is
    that we want to be able to press both keys at the same time, without
    one of them winning, so we check for the keys in two steps: 1) are
    either A or D pressed? If so, 2a) is A pressed, and 2b) is D pressed.
    If A is pressed, we will be walking left, so we give Mario an impulse
    of -2, horizontally, and 0, vertically (because running is a horizontal-only
    affair). However, if you scroll up to the pictures we had for running,
    they're for running to the right. In order to make sure we run to the
    left with the pictures oriented correctly, we need to make sure that
    they are flipped.</p>
    
    <p>If D is pressed we do roughly the same thing, but in the opposite
    direction: a horizontal impulse of 2, rather than -2, and we make
    sure the pictures are NOT flipped, so look like they run to the right.
    Finally, at the end of the first "if" block, we make sure that Mario's
    state is indeed the running state, by setting the current state to "running".
    Makes sense, really!</p>

    <p>Then, the second "if" block. In this block we check for the 'W' key,
    which is our jumping key. However, we can't "just jump", there's a few
    conditions that need to be met. First, we can only jump if 'W' is pressed.
    Okay, so that one is obvious. Second, we can only jump if we're not
    already jumping right now. This prevents us from jumping while we're
    already jumping. Because that would just be weird! Finally, we also 
    don't want to jump unless we're actually standing on something. This last
    one, especially, is important. We don't want to be able to jump in mid air
    while we're falling from a platform, for instance. Or rather... for the 
    moment, we don't, but once we're done with this game, <i>maybe</i> we
    actually do want to change that... hmmm... anyway, on to the rest of the code:
    All those conditions are combined with "&amp;&amp;" which is programming-code
    for "AND". So, we have if(something AND something AND something) { [then do this] }.
    We don't actually use the word "AND" for it, but use "&amp;&amp;" because
    that's how programming languages have been doing things for decades, so it's
    one of those things you quickly learn to use and expect everywhere.</p>
    
    <p>So with all those conditions met, what do we do? Well, we give Mario
    a jolt of speed upwards, -35 in fact, and we make sure that his state
    is the "jumping" state, so that it looks like he's jumping. Perfect!
    So what's with that last block?</p>
    
    <p>The last block checks "are we actually pressing any key?". If we're
    not pressing left, or up, or right, then it's a good idea to make sure
    that Mario looks like he's just standing there, so we set his state
    to "idle" if no relevant keys are pressed. So with all that work done,
    what does Mario look like?</p>

      <canvas data-processing-sources="codebase.pde preloads.pde sketches/mario/sketch04.pde"></canvas>
       <figcaption>A much nicer looking Mario</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>Hmm... that's actually a bit too fast. By default, the game library
    will run our games at 60 frames per second. That's really high, so let's
    set that to 30 instead:</p>
    
    <textarea readonly style="width: 40em; height: 5em;">
void initialize() {
  addLevel("level", new MarioLevel(width, height));  
  frameRate(30);
}
</textarea>

    <p>Now what does it look like?</p>

    <figure>
      <canvas data-processing-sources="codebase.pde preloads.pde sketches/mario/sketch04b.pde"></canvas>
       <figcaption>Now at 30 frames per second</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>That's better. On to making this prettier!</p>
    
    <h2>Polishing Mario's interaction</h2>
    
    <p>While the input handling we have works, you might notice that it's doing funny things
    when you jump and run left or right at the same time. So let's fix that. Instead of 
    making jumping a normal state, let's make it special. The game library lets you add
    specific durations to states, so that when you change to them, they last for a 
    specific number of frames, and then give you a signal that they're done. That way,
    we can prevent Mario from changing states or triggering behaviour while he's jumping.
    This means we have to do two things: 1) say that jumping is a special state, with
    a specific duration, and 2) make sure the input handling takes into account that
    we might not be able to change states while Mario is jumping. Let's-a-di-go!</p>

<textarea readonly style="width: 60em; height: 32em;">
  void setupStates() {
    [...]
    
    State jumping = new State("jumping", "graphics/mario/small/Jumping-mario.gif");
    jumping.setDuration(15);
    addState(jumping);

    setCurrentState("idle");    
  }

  void handleInput() {
    if(isKeyDown('A') || isKeyDown('D')) {
      [...]
      // we remove setCurrentState("running") here!
    }

    if(isKeyDown('W') && active.name!="jumping" && boundaries.size()>0) {
      [...]
    }
    
    if (active.mayChange()) {
      if(isKeyDown('A') || isKeyDown('D')) {
        setCurrentState("running");
      }
      else { setCurrentState("idle"); }
    }
  } 
</textarea>

    <p>As you can see, the only thing we have to change for the jumping
    state is saying "this state has a duration". In this case, we've set
    it to 15 frames (and since the game plays at 30 frames per second,
    that means a jump lasts half a second) and that's all we have to do!
    Then, in our input handling, we can make use of two special things.
    First, the <code>active</code> word means "the currently active state".
    If we've set the current state to "idle", then <code>active</code> points
    to the idle state. If we've set it to "jumping", then <code>active</code>
    points to the jumping state. That's pretty useful, because it lets us
    check whether the "current state" is one of those special states that
    we shouldn't interrupt: <code>active.mayChange()</code> gives us a "yes"/"no"
    answer to the question "is this a special state, and if so, has it finished
    so that we may change to another state already?".</p>
    
    <p>Making use of <code>active.mayChange()</code>, we can now say: "IF
    we're allowed to change states, then check if they running keys are 
    pressed. If so, change state to running. Otherwise, change it to just
    standing around, being idle". So now we should be able to do strange
    super-power jumping anymore if we jump and move to the left or right
    at the same time:</p>

    <figure>
      <canvas data-processing-sources="codebase.pde preloads.pde sketches/mario/sketch05.pde"></canvas>
       <figcaption>A much nicer jumping Mario</figcaption>
    </figure>  
    
    <p>So, now that we have a reasonably well-controlled Mario, I think
    it's time we jazzed this game up a little with some good looks.
    What do you think?</p>
    
    <h2>Of course, we need a background...</h2>
    
    <p>Let's start with that background. It's boring, right? I mean, sure, it's
    a pretty color but it just... a plain color. How about instead we add
    some background in the Mario style?</p>
    
    <p>Let's add the following background:</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="graphics/backgrounds/sky.gif">
      <figcaption>A background with Mario 'mountains'</figcaption>
    </figure>  

<textarea readonly style="width: 70em; height: 18em;">
class MarioLayer extends LevelLayer {
  MarioLayer(Level owner) {
    super(owner);

    setBackgroundColor(color(0, 100, 190));
    Sprite background_picture = new Sprite("graphics/backgrounds/sky.gif");
    TilingSprite background = new TilingSprite(background_picture,0,0,width,height);
    addStaticSpriteBG(background);

    addBoundary(new Boundary(0,height-48,width,height-48));
    showBoundaries = true;
    Mario mario = new Mario(width/4, height/2);
    addPlayer(mario);
  }
}
</textarea>

    <p>The important line is that <code>addStaticSpriteBG(...)</code> line. This says
    "Add something, which is inside the ( and ), to the list of background sprites." with
    the word "static" simply meaning "things that don't change". In this case we add
    what is known as a "Tiling Sprite" - a picture that is repeated to fill a certain area
    of the screen. Since we want the background to fill the entire level, we use a picture
    of a typical Mario sky line, and make it repeat itself starting at (0,0), which is the
    upper left corner of the level, all the way down to (width,height), which is the lower
    right corner of the level.</p>
    
    <p>We could keep it at that, but since we're updating the background anyway, let's make
    sure that Mario can't run out of the level:</p>

<textarea readonly style="width: 70em; height: 12em;">
class MarioLayer extends LevelLayer {
  MarioLayer(Level owner) {
    [...]
    addBoundary(new Boundary(0,height-48,width,height-48));
    addBoundary(new Boundary(-1,0, -1,height));
    addBoundary(new Boundary(width+1,height, width+1,0));
    showBoundaries = true;
    [...]
  }
}
</textarea>

    <p>These two extra boundaries sit *just* outside the level on the left and the right,
    like what we did in the previous tutorial to keep our "Thingy" inside the screen. 
    Except this time our Thingy is a Mario! =D</p>
    
    <p>And because we can, let's make one more change: a background is nice, but it
    would be even better if we could actually see that it repeats, by making the level
    wider than a single screen. So... let's do that!</p>

<textarea readonly style="width: 40em; height: 15em;">
void initialize() {
  frameRate(30);
  addLevel("level", new MarioLevel(2*width, height));  
}

class MarioLevel extends Level {
  MarioLevel(float levelWidth, float levelHeight) {
    super(levelWidth, levelHeight);
    addLevelLayer("layer", new MarioLayer(this));
    setViewBox(0,0,screenWidth,screenHeight);
  }
}
</textarea>

    <p>Two things to note are that in our <code>initialize</code> method,
    we now make a MarioLevel that is twice as wide as the screen. In order
    to make sure that game library doesn't get confused, we then also
    tell it that the <code>viewbox</code> for this game starts at (0,0),
    which is the upper left of the screen, and is only <code>screenWidth</code>
    wide, and <code>screenHeight</code> high, so it is exactly the same
    size as our game "window". If we left it at this, we would see Mario
    run to the right and then disappear, but the viewbox is special: it
    can follow a player around. So we make one final change:</p>


<textarea readonly style="width: 40em; height: 17em;">
class MarioLayer extends LevelLayer {
  Mario mario;
  
  MarioLayer(Level owner) {
    [...]
    mario = new Mario(width/4, height/2);
    addPlayer(mario);
  }
  
  void draw() {
    super.draw();
    viewbox.track(parent, mario);
  }
}
</textarea>

    <p>We've done two things here. First, we've made the level layer always "know" what
    the <code>mario</code> word refers to. Now, if we refer to <code>mario</code> in any
    of the methods of the level layer, it will know what to use. That's important, because
    the viewbox needs to know who it should be following around when the level layer is
    being drawn. That's the second thing we changed. Normally a level layer has a premade
    method called "draw" that it kind of "inherits" from the game library. But, it only
    draws the level layer, it doesn't do anything else. If we want to make the viewbox
    follow Mario around, we'll need to set up instructions that say "do what you normally
    do, but ALSO follow mario!". So that's what we do: <code>super.draw()</code> is the
    line that says "do what you normally do", namely call the "draw" method that the level
    layer already knows about, because it is part of its super class (remember super
    classes from the previous tutorial?). Then the next instruction is to the viewbox:
    <code>viewbox.track(parent, mario)</code> tells the viewbox to follow mario around,
    using the visual properties of the level that the level layer is in, which the
    level layed calls its <code>parent</code>. Whenever the level layer needs to 
    point to its owning level, we can use the word <code>parent</code> and the game
    library will know what to do. Especially now, that's pretty handy.</p>
    
    <p>Okay! That's enough! We added background. We added walls to the left and right.
    We made the level bigger than the screen. We (hopefully!) made the screen "follow"
    Mario... what does it look like already!??!</p>

    <figure>
      <canvas data-processing-sources="codebase.pde preloads.pde sketches/mario/sketch06.pde"></canvas>
       <figcaption>So much goodness!</figcaption>
    </figure>  
    
    <p>Now that's what I call pretty cool! We can run around and the background
    will scroll along, until we reach either end of the level and we simply
    walk into the side walls.</p>

    <p>So... how about we make it even cooler?</p>
    
    <h2>This game needs ground and stuff!</h2>

    <p>We've been putting it off long enough: having Mario walk on a thin little
    line works, but things will look a lot better if we make him walk on some
    actual ground. Or at least, if we make it LOOK as if he is. Let's start
    creating some ground, shall we?</p>
    
    <p>Ground is actually quite similar to adding background. Since the only
    thing that determines whether Mario's "on something" or not is the (normally)
    invisible boundaries (which we can see right now because we're cheating and
    we're drawing them, even though normally you don't), we can actually just
    leave the boundary where it is, and set up some more background that makes it
    look like there's ground underneat the boundary line.</p>
    
    <p>In order to make ground, we're going to use a few images. Two, in fact.
    One to look like the top soil, with grass, and one that fills in the region
    underneath:</p>
    
    <figure>
      <img src="graphics/backgrounds/ground-top.gif"> + <img src="graphics/backgrounds/ground-filler.gif">
      <figcaption>grassy soil!</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The trick is to lay down a row of top soil, and then fill in the rest
    with filler. We've actually already seen how we are supposed to do this:
    we use a TilingSprite. First, let's define a method for "laying" ground:</p>
    
<textarea readonly style="width: 60em; height: 19em;">
class MarioLayer extends LevelLayer {
  [...]
  
  void addGround(float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2) {
    Sprite grassy = new Sprite("graphics/backgrounds/ground-top.gif");
    TilingSprite groundline = new TilingSprite(grassy, x1,y1,x2,y1+16);
    addStaticSpriteBG(groundline);

    Sprite filler = new Sprite("graphics/backgrounds/ground-filler.gif");
    TilingSprite groundfiller = new TilingSprite(filler, x1,y1+16,x2,y2);
    addStaticSpriteBG(groundfiller);

    addBoundary(new Boundary(x1,y1,x2,y1));
  }  
}
</textarea>

    <p>This method expects four values when we use it: the first two
    are the top-left x/y coordinates for the ground we'll place,
    and the last two are the bottom-right x/y coordinates, so we're
    supposed to draw ground in the rectangle between those two coordinates.
    The top-most row has to be grassy ground, so we use the grassy picture,
    and make a TilingSprite that runs from (x1,y1), which is our indiated
    top left corner, to (x2,y1+16).</p>

    <p>What do those values mean? Well, x2 is the horizontal coordinate for the
    right-most edge of the rectangle we want to fill. So that one's pretty
    easy. "y1+16" means "the top coordinate value, plus 16 pixels". We add
    16 pixels because we know the picture for the grass is 16 pixels high.
    So we want to draw a row of grass that starts at (0,0) and is exactly
    16 pixels high, and the normal width wide.</p>
    
    <p>After that, we fill the rest with filler pictures. This doesn't start
    at (x1,y1), but at (x1,y1+16), because we need to start at the same horizontal
    position, but 16 pixels lower (or we'd be drawing filler on top of the grass!).
    And then it has to be wide enough to reach x2, horizontally, and high enough
    to reach y2, vertically.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, because ground acts as something Mario can stand on, we add
    a boundary that runs along the top of the grass, so that Mario has something
    to stand on. And with that, we add some ground to our level layer:<p>
    
<textarea readonly style="width: 40em; height: 13em;">
class MarioLayer extends LevelLayer {
  [...]

  MarioLayer(Level owner) {
    [...]
    addGround(-32,height-48, width+32,height);
  }

  [...]
}
</textarea>

    <p>Now we'll have ground running across the screen, from 32 pixels "outside"
    the screen on the left, to 32 pixels "outside" the screen on the right, filling
    an area with height "height of the screen, minus 48 pixels" to "height of the screen".
    What does that look like? Well, this:</p>

    <figure>
      <canvas data-processing-sources="codebase.pde preloads.pde sketches/mario/sketch08.pde"></canvas>
       <figcaption>Now with ground to stand on!</figcaption>
    </figure>  
    
    <p>What a difference some ground can make!</p>
    
    <p>There's another thing we can do that also makes a neat difference,
    and that's adding a second layer of background that looks like it's
    farther away, so that when we walk, it moves slower than the normal
    background.</p>
    
    <p>We can do this really easily by adding a new layer to our level,
    one that we'll simply stick behind the real layer that has Mario on it.
    In fact, the code for it is not very long, can you tell what it does?</p>

<textarea readonly style="width: 70em; height: 35em;">
class MarioLevel extends Level {
  MarioLevel(float levelWidth, float levelHeight) {
    [...]
    addLevelLayer("background", new BackgroundLayer(this));
    addLevelLayer("layer", new MarioLayer(this));
  }
}

class BackgroundLayer extends LevelLayer {
  BackgroundLayer(Level owner) {
    super(owner, owner.width, owner.height, 0, 0, 0.75, 0.75);
    setBackgroundColor(color(0, 100, 190));
    addStaticSpriteBG(new TilingSprite(new Sprite("graphics/backgrounds/sky_2.gif"),0,0,width,height));
  }
}

class MarioLayer extends LevelLayer {
  Mario mario;

  MarioLayer(Level owner) {
    super(owner);
    // we no longer have a background color in the main level layer now
    addStaticSpriteBG(new TilingSprite(new Sprite("graphics/backgrounds/sky.gif"),0,0,width,height));
    [...]  
  }

  [...]
}
</textarea>

    <p>The important part is that new <code>BackgroundLayer</code> class, which does something
    special. Unlike a normal layer, such as the <code>MarioLayer</code>, the BackgroundLayer
    has a more elaborate call to tell its super class what's up: it gives it seven values instead
    of one! The first value is the same as for normal layers: the Level that this layer should
    be in. So far so good. Then, it tells it what that level's width and height are. This is important,
    because those are needed to do something intelligent with the following four values: the first
    two are "shifting" values, which let us say by how much this layer is shifted left or right,
    as well as up or down. We don't want that right now, so we keep both of those zero. Then,
    the two values after that tell the layer by how much it is scaled. This is very important!
    To make it look like this layer is farther away, we want it to move slower than the main
    level layer with Mario in it. Since we can't tell layers how fast they need to move, we
    instead tell them that they are bigger or smaller than the main level. This makes the game
    library squash or stretch the level, so that the start and end match up -- if we
    add a layer that is larger than the main layer, it will be squashed, and it'll look
    like it scrolls faster than the main layer. And of course the other way around; if we add
    a layer that is smaller, it will be stretch, and will look like it's scrolling slower. So 
    that's what we do, we say that this new background layer is only 0.75 the size of the
    main layer. So it should scroll slower. Let's find out:<p>

       <figcaption>And now with a prettier background!</figcaption>
    </figure>  

    <p>go ahead, make Mario run to the right. Notice how our new background moves
    slower than the one we already had? Does it make it look like this new background
    is farther away? Cool, eh?</p>
    
    <p>Now we have a great start for a real game: we have a Mario, we have cool
    backgrounds, and we have some ground to run on. Time to start adding finishing
    touches, what do you say?</p>

    <h2>Let's add some platforming elements </h2>

    <p>So far we've been so caught up in adding cool things that we completely forgot that the point
