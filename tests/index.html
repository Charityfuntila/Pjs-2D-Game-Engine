   * Line-through-box intersection algorithm.
   *
   * There are a few possibilities, with B() meaning
   * "on blocking side", I() meaning "intersecting"
   * and P() meaning "on pass-through side":
   *
   *               |
   * (1)  []  []  <|    =  B(prev), B(current)
   *               |
   *
   *              |
   * (2)  []    [<|]   =  B(prev), B(current) and I(current) and P(current)
   *              |
   *
   *           |
   * (3)  []  <|  []   =  B(prev), P(current)
   *           |
   *
   *        |
   * (4)  [<|]    []   =  B(prev) and I(prev) and P(prev), P(current)
   *        |
   *
   *
   *       |
   * (5)  <|  []  []   =  P(prev), P(current)
   *       |
   *
   * By computing the dot product for the eight corners of the two bounding
   * boxes, we can determine which of these situations we are in. Only in
   * (2) and (3) should we signal an intersection occuring. While (4) might
   * look like another case in which this should happen, we assume that
   * because the "previous" state is boundary overlapping, it was permitted
   * earlier (for instance, it moved through the boundary in the allowed
   * direction, but then moved back before having fully passed the boundary).
